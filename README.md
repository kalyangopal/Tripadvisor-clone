## Project Description  
This project is a front-end clone of the *TripAdvisor* website. The goal was to recreate the website's UI using semantic HTML, CSS, and media queries. It focuses on replicating the design, layout, and responsiveness to improve my skills in front-end development.  

## Features  
- Fully responsive UI design for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.  
- Semantic HTML structure for better readability and SEO.  
- Styled components including navigation bar, search bar, cards, and footer.

## Technologies Used

## Responsive Design
  This project adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using CSS media queries:
    - Desktop Breakpoint: Above 1024px
    - Tablet Breakpoint: 768px - 1024px
